GIT: GLOBAL INFORMATION TRACKER
SCM: SOURCE CODE MANAGEMENT TOOL
VCS: VERSION CONTROL SYSTEM

ALTERS: SVN, MERCURY

YEAR: 2005
INVENTED BY: LINUS TORVALDS
PROGRAMMING: C 
TYPE: OPEN SOURCE
GENERATION: 3RD 

BEFORE GIT:
SCCM -- > RCS -- > CVS -- > SVN -- > GIT 

DVCS: STORE CODE ON MULTIPLE REPOS
EX: GIT
CVCS: STORE CODE ON SINGE REPOS
EX: SVN

STAGES OF GIT:
Git have total 3 stages.

1. WORKING DIRECTORY:
Its a folder where we write the code.
here we can't track the files.

2. STAGING AREA:
here we can track the files.
its next version of your file.


3. REPOSITORY:
it's a folder where we can store tracked file.


BRANCHES:
It's an individual line of development for code.
we create different branches in real-time.
each developer will work on their own branch.
At the end we will combine all branches together in GitHub.
Default branch is Master.
EX: main, feature, release, hotfix ----

git branch		: to list the branches
git branch movies	: to create a new branch
git checkout movies	: to switch from one branch to another.
git checkout -b recharge: to create and switch from one branch to another.
git branch -m old new	: to rename a branch
git branch -D movies	: to delete a branch

GIT RESTORE: to restore the deleted files & used to untrack the tracked files.
git restore file1 : to get deleted file
git restore --staged file1 : to untrack the tracked file


Note: here every dev works on the local laptop
at the end we want all dev codes to create an application.
so here we use GitHub to combine all dev codes together.

git remote add origin https://github.com/revathisiriki78/paytm.git
git push origin movies

password:

GIT MERGE: it is used to merge the file blw two branches.
git checkout master
git merge movies

GIT REBASE: it is used to merge the file blw two branches.
git rebase recharge

MERGE VS REBASE:
merge for public repos, rebase for private 
merge stores history, rebase will not store the entire history
merge will show files, rebase will not show files

PULL REQUEST: MERGING THE BRANCHES IN GITHUB

GIT REVERT: To undo the merging blw two branches.

GIT CLONE: TO copy remote repo to local.
git clone https://github.com/RAHAMSHAIK007/6pmnewpaytm.git

GIT FORK: To copy repo from one GitHub account to another GitHub account.

NOTE: to do a fork or clone repo must be public.

MERGE CONFLICTS:
it will rise when we merge 2 different branches with same files.
How to resolve: Manually 

CHERRY PICK: it will merge  specific files from one branch to another branch based on commits.
git cherry-pick commit_id

GIT LOGS: used to show the information of files, commits and metadata.

GIT SHOW: To show the files attached to commits.
git show commit_id


GIT STASH: used to hide all the un comitted files.

GIT PULL: used to get the latest code from Git Hub to git.
Note: if the content in github and git is same it will not work.

git pull origin master

GIT FETCH: used to show the latest code from Git Hub to git.
git fetch origin master
git fetch 

.gitignore: used to ignore the files. here files cant be tracked.
