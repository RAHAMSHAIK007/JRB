DOCKER COMPOSE:
It's a tool used to manage multiple containers in single host.
we can create, start, stop, and delete all containers together.
we write container information in a file called a compose file.
compose file is in YAML format.
inside the compose file we can give images, ports, and volumes info of containers.
we need to download this tool and use it.

INSTALLATION:
sudo curl -L "https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/1.29.1/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m)" -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
ls /usr/local/bin/
sudo ln -s /usr/local/bin/docker-compose /usr/bin/docker-compose
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
docker-compose version

NOTE: linux will not give some commands, so to use them we need to download seperately
once a command is downloaded we need to move it to /usr/local/bin
because all the user executed commands in linux will store in /usr/local/bin
executebel permission need to execute the command

COMMANDS:
docker-compose up -d		: to create and start all containers
docker-compose stop		: to stop all containers
docker-compose start		: to start all containers
docker-compose kill		: to kill all containers
docker-compose rm		: to delete all containers
docker-compose down		: to stop and delete all containers
docker-compose pause		: to pause all containers
docker-compose unpause		: to unpause all containers

docker-compose images		: to list the images managed by compose file
docker-compose logs		: to show logs of docker compose
docker-compose top		: to show the process of compose containers
docker-compose restart		: to restart all the compose containers
docker-compose scale train=10	: to scale the service


CHANGING THE DEFULT FILE:
by default the docker-compose wil support the following names
docker-compose.yml, docker-compose.yaml, compose.yml, compose.yaml

mv docker-compose.yml raham.yml
docker-compose up -d	: throws an error

docker-compose -f raham.yml up -d
docker-compose -f raham.yml ps
docker-compose -f raham.yml down


images we create on server.
these images will work on only this server.

git (local) -- > github (internet) = to access by others
image (local) -- > dockerhub (internet) = to access by others


STEPS:
create dockerhub account
create a repo
