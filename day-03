CRON JOB: We can schedule the jobs that need to be run at a particular intervals.
here we use cron syntax
cron syntax is having * * * * *
each * is separated by space

*	: minutes
*	: hours
*	: date
*	: month
*	: day of week (sun=0, mon=1 ----)

limitation: it will not check the code is changed or not.


POLL SCM: 
in pollscm we will set time limit for the jobs.
if dev commit the code it will wait until the time is done.
in given time if we have any changes on code it will generate a build

create a ci job -- > Build Triggers -- > poll scm -- > * * * * * -- > save
commit the changes in GitHub then wait for 1 min.

1. in pollscm, we need to wait for the time we set.
2. we will get the last commit only.

WEBHOOK: it will trigger build the moment we change the code.
here we need not to wait for the build.

repo -- > settings -- > webhooks -- > add webhook -- > Payload URL (jenkins url) -- > http://35.180.46.134:8080/github-webhook/  -- > Content type -- > application/json -- > add

create ci job -- > Build Triggers: GitHub hook trigger for GITScm polling -- > save

Build executor means number of parallel builds we can run 

Dashboard -- > Build executor status -- > Nodes -- > Built-In Node -- > Configure -- > Number of executors: 4 -- > save 

job -- > selecet -- > Execute concurrent builds if necessary -- > save and build for 5 times

THROTTLE BUILD:

To restrict the builds in a certain time or intervals.
if we dont rsetrict due to immediate builds jenkins might crashdown.

by default jenkins will not do couurent builds.
we need to enable this option in configuration.

Execute concurrent builds if necessary -- > tick it

create a ci job -- > configure -- > Throttle builds -- > Number of builds: 2 -- > time period : hours -- > save

LINKEDJOB: ONE JOB WILL BUILD AFTER OTHER JOB IS BUILD.
UPSTREAM
DOWNSTRAM

BUILD SCRIPTS: to make jenkins builds from remote loc using script/
give token 
give url on other browser.

if jenkins is crashed restart the server
