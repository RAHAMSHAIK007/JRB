pv:

Persistent means always available.
PVs are independent they can exist even if no pod is using them.
it is created by administrator or dynamically created by a storage class. 
Once a PV is created, it can be bound to a Persistent Volume Claim (PVC), which is a request for storage by a pod.
When a pod requests storage via a PVC, K8S will search for a suitable PV to satisfy the request. 
PV is bound to the PVC and the pod can use the storage. 
If no suitable PV is found, K8S will either dynamically create a new one (if the storage class supports dynamic provisioning) or the PVC will remain unbound.

pvc:

To use Pv we need to claim the volume using PVC.
PVC request a PV with your desired specification (size, access, modes & speed etc) from k8s and onec a suitable PV is found it will bound to PVC
After bounding is done to pod you can mount it as a volume.
once userfinised iyts work the attached PV can be released the underlying PV can be reclaimed & recycled for future.

RESTRICTIONS:
1. Instances must be on same az as the ebs 
2. EBS supports only a sinlge EC2 instance mounting
